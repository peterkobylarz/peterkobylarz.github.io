My name is Peter Kobylarz and I live in Arvada, Colorado with my wife Danielle and our 2 year old dog Cooper. We try to spend as much time skiing as possible during the winter. In the summer we like to explore the mountains and forage for wild mushrooms.

I graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2007 with bachelor degrees in Geography and Political Science. I originally planned on studying Computer Science but fell in love with the complex and important discipline of Geography after taking a course on global inequality. Through my Geography coursework, I discovered GIS, which was a way for me to combine my interests in these two fields. I haven't pursued any graduate studies since then and I am excited for the opportunity the Earth Data Analytics certificate program offers!

I'm a GIS professional with 16 years of experience and I currently work for a firm called WRA Environmental Consultants as the GIS Technical Team Leader. I've been at WRA for 9 years and prior to that I was a GIS Specialist for Mono County, California. At WRA, I work on a broad spectrum of projects including environmental permitting and entitlement, restoration design and implementation, mitigation banking, and community resilience. I have spent a large portion of the last five years focused on wildfire related projects, specifically post-wildfire recovery efforts for the 2017 North Bay fires, the 2018 Camp fire, and the 2020 Oregon fires. I also work closely with WRA's Community Resiliency team to help clients and communities prepare for wildfires through fuel treatment projects, grant support, and other resiliency efforts.

I'm interested in formally developing my very self-taught Python skills and learning how to work with big data sets generated by platforms such as Sentinel 2 and GOES. I'm also interesting in developing relationships with other professionals who are involved in community resilience, particuarly relating to wildfire.
